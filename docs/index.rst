Summary
-------

This is a command line python program to search keywords/key-phrases on Google Images
and optionally download images to your computer. You can also invoke this script from
another python file.

This is a small and ready-to-run program. No dependencies are required to be installed
if you would only want to download up to 100 images per keyword. If you would want **more than 100
images** per keyword, then you would need to install ``Selenium`` library along with ``chromedriver``.
